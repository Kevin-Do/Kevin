# Start Here

So I began by removing wolfram alpha for more disc space. I then update and upgrade any existing packages. Also installed vital apps like Iceweasel (a rendition of Firefox) and Git. 

1. sudo apt-get purge wolfram-engine
2. sudo apt-get update
3. sudo apt-get upgrade
4. sudo apt-get git
5. sudo apt-get iceweasel
6. // Follow the commands in the link //
7. // Will take a long time! //
