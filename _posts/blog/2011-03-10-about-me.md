Hi, I'm Kevin, I'm based in San Diego and I'm a student at San Diego State University!  

As Computer Engineering Major and Computer Science Minor, I've been fortunate to work a variety of internships and lead several organizations.  

I've competed in Cyber Defence competitions, engineering hackathons and electric boat racing!    

I've been written code in **Python, Java, C++, and Javascript** and I'm a firm believer in deliberate practice and a love for your craft.  

As such, I code and continually build my [projects]({{ site.url }}/articles)  everyday!  

I'm always looking to discuss innovative ideas or business inquiries!
