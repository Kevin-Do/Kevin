# Hi, I'm Kevin!



### I'm based in San Diego and I'm a student at San Diego State University!  


### As Computer Engineering Major and Computer Science Minor, I've been fortunate to work a variety of internships and lead several organizations.  

### I've competed in Cyber Defense competitions, engineering hackathons and competitive boat & drone building!


### I write code in **Python, Java, C++, and Javascript** and I'm a firm believer in deliberate practice and a love for your craft.

### Here you'll find my projects, personal posts and development blog!
